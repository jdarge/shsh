# shsh
todo: 
* -lpthread (BSD)
* Tab complete works by finding bin files even if for example its not the first command 
<code>ls[tab] vs ls [tab]</code>
* Using arrow keys to traverse acts as an insert marker instead of a cursor
* Resizing window or adjusting font size results in the loss of text, should refresh text (somehow)
* New internal command: alias
* History stored persession instead of saving via file
* The "invalid command" message is currently useless
