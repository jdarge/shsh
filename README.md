<br>Tab complete works by finding bin files even if for example its not the first command 
<code>ls[tab] vs ls [tab]</code>
<br>Using arrow keys to traverse acts as an insert marker instead of a cursor
<br>Resizing window or adjusting font size results in the loss of text, should refresh text (somehow)
<br>New internal command: alias
